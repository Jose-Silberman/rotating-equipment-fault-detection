# Rotating Equipment Fault Detection (Industrial MLOps)

This repository implements an end-to-end industrial MLOps framework for early fault detection in rotating equipment used in upstream oil & gas operations.

The project focuses on:
- Asset-centric time series data
- Industrial data pipelines (historian-like)
- Reproducible ML pipelines
- Model lifecycle management and monitoring

The emphasis is on **architecture, MLOps practices, and operational realism**, rather than on complex ML models.

## Scope
- Batch-oriented data ingestion and inference
- Unsupervised / semi-supervised fault detection
- Synthetic but industrially realistic datasets

## Status
Project under active development.
